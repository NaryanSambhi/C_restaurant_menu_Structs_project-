ex. the user cannot input a character when they are supposed to do a number
get num function solves this 

-check does the file save or not, look through the file contents 

- check if the delete function works is by adding a menu item and see does it appear, if so then delete it and press display recipes, it should not be there anymore

- check if add function function works is by adding a menu item and check does it appear in display recipes 

- check the search recipe functions is add an recipe and type it in the search function 

- check if a user input is also valid in a range is to use the get num function as the user can only enter up to 24 slots
